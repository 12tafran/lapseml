  A Simple summary goes here.
abstract: |
  A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research articles, 
  abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We strongly encourage
  authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without 
  headings: 1) Background: Place the question addressed in a broad context and
  highlight the purpose of the study; 2) Methods: Describe briefly the main
  methods or treatments applied; 3) Results: Summarize the article's main 
  findings; and 4) Conclusion: Indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. 
  The abstract should be an objective representation of the article, it must not 
  contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and 
  should not exaggerate the main conclusions.
keywords: |
  keyword 1; keyword 2; keyword 3 (list three to ten pertinent keywords specific 
  to the article, yet reasonably common within the subject discipline.).
acknowledgement: |
  All sources of funding of the study should be disclosed. Please clearly 
  indicate grants that you have received in support of your research work. 
  Clearly state if you received funds for covering the costs to publish in open 
  access.
authorcontributions: |
  For research articles with several authors, a short paragraph specifying their 
  individual contributions must be provided. The following statements should be 
  used ``X.X. and Y.Y. conceive and designed the experiments; X.X. performed the 
  experiments; X.X. and Y.Y. analyzed the data; W.W. contributed 
  reagents/materials/analysis tools; Y.Y. wrote the paper.'' Authorship must be
  limited to those who have contributed substantially to the work reported.
